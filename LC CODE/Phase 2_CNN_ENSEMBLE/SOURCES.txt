Various sources of information including grt123, julian de wit, the nodulex system, and kaggle kernels were used in developing my algorithm. I have their contributions to the developed code stated below:

grt123-- the unet architecture (modified for 3D)
julian de wit-- The 3D Vgg-like network architecture and anomalous tissue detector (used in my ensemble) were components of his solutions. However, they were modified in my algorithm. 
nodulex-- the use of morphological features in a radiomics approach
kaggle kernels-- preprocessing techniques

I would like to thank these sources for aiding me in the development of the system; their open-source solutions granted me inspiration and references to solve this challenging problem.
